    Get a list of all edges in the graph and sort them by increasing weight.
Create a disjoint sets structure where each vertex is represented by a set.
Traverse the list from the start (i.e., from lightest weight to heaviest).

    Inspect the current edge. If that edge connects two vertices from different sets, union their respective sets and mark the edge as part of the MST. Otherwise there would be a cycle, so do nothing.
    Repeat this until nâˆ’1

edges have been added, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
